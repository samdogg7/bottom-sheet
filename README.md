Please keep in mind that Bottom Sheet is still in beta. Some documentation is missing, more modifiers coming soon!

# Bottom Sheet
A small and lightweight library that adds a bottom sheet that can be used with TabView to make it stay on top. And more!

![example-ezgif com-video-to-gif-converter-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a28b9c81-7a19-4873-8aef-9a5a4f67cd9d)


# Why?
The main idea behind BottomSheet is to allow you to add a sheet that can be displayed below the TabView rather than with the native .sheet, which will always be shown on top of all elements.
BottomSheet can be used to recreate the sheet from Apple Maps, Shortcuts and Apple Music.

# Requirements
